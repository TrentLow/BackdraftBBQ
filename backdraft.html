<h1>About</h1>
<p>Backdraft Cafe and BBQ is a small town diner in the middle of Berthold, ND.  We strive to bring you high quality food and atmosphere. 
It is the home of the one and only Backdraft Brisket Burger, a cheese burger with a slice of some of the best smoked brisket you may ever taste.
The diner was established November 2018, under the management of Kalvin Myers, and Kevin Archer. These two guys take great pride in what they dish up!
Not only does this small town eatery have a top tier location, they will bring the food to you!! Call now to place your catering needs!</p>
